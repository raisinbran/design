	<p class="left">I am a senior in the Manufacturing and Design Engineering (MaDE) program at Northwestern University. MaDE is a hybrid of mechanical engineering, industrial engineering, and user-centered product design. In addition, I am studying toward the ISEN (Institute for Sustainability & Energy at Northwestern) Certificate to learn more about life-cycle analysis and sustainable design. Most recently I was a <a href="/projects">design engineer intern.</a></p>
