<h1>About Me</h1>
<p class="left">I am currently studying Manufacturing and Design Engineering (MaDE) at the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science at Northwestern University. MaDe is a hybrid of mechanical engineering, industrial engineering, and user-centered product design.<br><br>In addition, I am studying toward Northwestern's ISEN (Institute for Sustainability & Energy) Certificate in order to further my interest and gain skills in sustainable design and life-cycle analysis.<br><br>Since childhood, I have been fascinated with art and design iteration (e.g. new editions of products); as an engineer, I can shape my creativity within the “engineering rigor” so that my ideas are ready for real-world implementation.<br><br>During my time at Northwestern, I have also discovered a love for machining and shopwork (that's when I knew I chose the right major), computer-aided design, and product sustainability and cost efficiency.<br><br>Resume is available upon request.</p>
