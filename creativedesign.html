These issues would also be brought up by other production artists. I therefore took it upon myself as a personal project to improve its content and layout. Changes include font standardization, rewritten step-by-step instructions, and media reformatting. For the curious, here is the <a href="images/CompshopAdProductionManual2017.pdf" target="_blank">full revised manual.</a></p>

          <p>​Since I was eight, when I proudly sold ten-cent copies of my stories to family friends, I have always been writing on my own time in some fashion. Growing up in an immigrant family that always seemed to teeter on the edge of financial and social instability, writing was a way for me to make sense of my world. In time, it also grew to encompass the lives of peers and aquaintances from all stages of life. Here is some of the work I'm most proud of:</p>

                          <p>
                            *<br><br>A snap, and a shudder.<br><br>
                            Aedior’s father signaled the pair of horses to stop the wagon, and he stumbled off the wagon with a huff.<br><br>
                            Aedior had already hopped off the wagon. The only child of the Ivontu family was crouching near the back left wheel of the wagon. Behind him, horses and people traveled through the street as they did in the thousand other streets of Novepore. Yeah, whatever, they wouldn’t even blink at us. Aedior forced himself to ignore the passersby.<br><br>
                            “What happened?” asked his father.<br><br>
                            Aedior pointed at two warped pieces of wood on the wheel. “You look at it. So bad in quality.” Aedior returned to the back of the wagon and half-sat, half-leaned against the edge. “You two always think ‘Where is something the cheapest?’ without thinking about if that thing is of good quality. And the reputation of the seller—you don’t even think about it. That’s why this happens.” Aedior bit his tongue, frustrated by his inability to speak proficiently in his family’s native language, Varsan. He shrugged his shoulders at his father. <i>I better do better than this sorry state when I have my own family.</i><br><br>
                            The beating heat on Aedior’s back prompted him to look up at the sky. The midday sun had moved so that the multi-storied buildings’ shadows no longer covered the wagon.<br><br>
                            Aedior’s mother turned around and glanced at the back of the wagon, but the stacks of pottery and wood prevented anyone from seeing the opposite side of the wagon relative to their position. “What are you doing now, Etaru?” she asked in Varsan with a tint of criticism.<br><br>
                            “You see it first before you start yelling at me.”<br><br>
                            Huffing, she finally got off the wagon.<br><br>
                            “See here? The spoke snapped. The wheel’s useless now. We’re basically screwed.” Aedior’s father swore again.<br><br>
                            “Be quiet.” His mother furrowed her eyebrows... for a very long time.<br><br>
                            Aedior wondered, <i>What’s taking so long?</i><br><br>
                            His mother suddenly walked to the front of the wagon and pushed everything back. “I’m going to die before I can dig through all this stuff. Why would you pile it up all here?” She finally emerged carrying a spare wheel.<br><br>
                            His father had been looking over the railing in the meantime. He was holding a ceramic shard embedded in a rectangular block of wood. “I repeatedly told you to wrap the thinner pottery and the woodcuts in cloth. You look at it! This time we really are screwed.”<br><br>
                            His mother did not reply, but Aedior had a feeling she had little remorse.<br><br>
                            *<br><br>
                            As they were getting back onto the wagon, his mother said in Varsan, “I’m surprised the wheel was so shoddy.”<br><br>
                            “Of course. Turmoskor craftspeople never focus on their products. But that’s what we have to work with.”<br><br>
                            “Why would you buy something of such low quality?”<br><br>
                            <i>Why would they?</i> wondered Aedior as well. <i>I know their native language, unlike me, is not Arnaskorian. But it’s still unbelievable that they continue to justify their lack of sync with Arnaskorian society with the excuse that they don’t understand much Arnaskorian. They’ve lived in Arnaskor for, what—more than sixteen years, since before I was born! I don’t see the parents of other Varsan children shoddily patching up their houses simply because they can’t converse with or trust an Arnaskorian builder.</i> Aedior recalled the homemade, poorly-painted door frames that his father had forcefully jammed into the undersized doorways of their house. Even now, the surrounding wall of each doorway had small cracks here and there.
                            “Why, you don’t know?” Aedior’s father looked truly shocked as he looked at his wife. “Because, Cervustol Volosial," using her full name, "you always yell at me when I buy something expensive. Nothing else is at the price you want except for Turmoskor goods. What else am I supposed to do?”<br><br>
                            “Well, you don’t make enough money, so no expensive purchases.”<br><br>
                            His father almost choked. “I would like to see what we own has been bought with money that you earned. Thank the gods I’m helping you improve your craft and make a name, however small, in Arnaskor. Otherwise, you wouldn’t even succeed in a thousand years.”<br><br>
                            “Su-succeed your head,” stuttered his mother in an attempt to defend her pride. From his seat at the back of the wagon, Aedior raised his eyebrows. <i>What kind of response was that?</i><br><br>
                            The cart veered to the side. Aedior refocused his attention on his surroundings. Everyone on the street was moving aside as a trio of fully plated cavalrymen passed through the center of the street. A blue-and-gold pennon fluttered past as well.<br><br>
                            Once the cavalrymen had disappeared around the corner, his father added, “And we’re definitely buying a better wagon wheel. My vocation has not been repairing the wagon every week for the last twenty years, and it won’t be so anytime in the future.”<br>
                            *<br>
                            A blanket of gray clouds covered Novepore in gloom.<br><br>
                            <i>This weather isn’t too bad: not too hot, not too cold. I can wear warm, comfortable clothes that I like, but I don’t have to bury myself in blankets.</i>
                            Aedior shoved his hands into his coat pockets as he walked through a street downhill, toward the city harbor. Eyes burned into his skull. <i>Don’t worry about walking alone. Plenty of other people are doing it too.</i><br><br>
                            The other people, it turned out, were disheveled, forgotten beggars or dusty, forgotten servants. Does everyone except me really have companions? He tried to not think about it. Mental hands tore apart images of couples and groups. A brick wall blocked more images.<br><br>
                            <i>... Isolated. Alone. Severed...</i> Aedior imagined himself tearing apart the images, over and over again. I’ll tire my mind so much that it won’t think of anything at all. Yeah, that's better.<br><br>
                            Ever since he was twelve, Aedior had blamed himself for his severe isolation. It was his fault for being quiet. It was his fault for being awkward when talking. A promise he had made to himself after his shaming at the Novepore spring festival four years ago—<i>I vow that I will adapt</i>—bore no fruit. <i>Those who can talk win in life. But my stupid mind won’t acknowledge that. Four years and I have little to show.</i><br><br>
                            When he had gradually come to realize that he had inherited his isolation from his parents, Aedior had been angry at his parents. They had come from Neovarsul, a kingdom west of the Sea of Ullormara. Aedior thought that an insufficient excuse. Other people from Neovarsul—Varsans, they were called—who had moved to Arnaskor, had adapted and integrated themselves into Arnaskorian society. <i>Only my parents can barely speak Arnaskorian, even after twenty years living here.</i><br><br>
                            Aedior wanted to hate his parents for sixteen years of suffering. He wanted so much to point a finger at them. He stopped short of entirely removing the blame from himself.<br><br>
                            He had reached the main city square, thronged by merchants, young men, and the like. <i>I hope I don’t recognize anyone here. They’ll immediately see that I’m a loner.</i> He sighed. <i>Why do I have to worry about these kind of things?</i><br><br>
                            Three people entered the square from the south street. “By the gods,” Aedior mumbled softly. But he did not change his course.<br><br>
                            When they approached him, Jon warmly greeted him with, “Hey, it’s that wench again!”<br><br>
                            Aedior mouthed <i>Wow</i>. The square was very noisy.<br><br>
                            Beside Jon were Ieiro and Ralf. None of them were native Arnaskorians.<br><br>
                            “Ivontu!” said Ieiro, using Aedior's last name as his nickname.<br><br>
                            “Yeah, hi, Siona." Aedior teasingly called Ieiro by the girl he admired. "Ieiro, just go marry her right now. Everybody knows that you two want to create an even, even, even more wealthy and influential family than is possible.” Aedior smirked at Ieiro and turned to Ralf. “Oh gods, it’s Ralf the try-hard.”<br><br>
                            Ralf did his signature moving of the jaw spasmodically. “Mmmm, Ivontu, you such a bad kid.”<br>
                            *<br>
                            Although they had long left the main city square, many shoppers and vendors crowded the west street heading to the harbor and the sea. The blanket of clouds shunned sunlight.<br><br>
                            Jon said, “You have no friends,” as Aedior was straining to hear Ieiro and Ralf’s conversation.<br><br>
                            “I know, right?” Aedior had heard that compliment for so long that he thought little of it. A lull, and then:<br><br>
                            “So my girlfriend’s parents are really happy ‘cause I convinced her to stop drinking.”<br><br>
                            “Uh... Oh wow, she drinks?” Aedior was truly surprised. “What kind of woman did you get this time?”<br><br>
                            “Well, I don’t really care about her drinking, but I just, like, influenced her to stop.”<br><br>
                            Aedior recalled the last four girlfriends that Jon had had over the years. “Do you think you will marry her?”<br><br>
                            “No, I have a girlfriend just for the fun of it. So I can make fun of you: 'Oh hoh hoh, you are all alone ‘cause nobody likes you and you’ll always be alone.’”
                            Ieiro chuckled. “You’re so mean, Jon.”<br><br>
                            Aedior waved his arms in the air. “Yay,” he said in mock enthusiasm.<br><br>
                            “Well, I’ll break up with her soon,” said Jon. “I’ll just wait until her birthday and say, ‘Go home, wench.’”<br><br>
                            <i>Not surprised.</i> Jon, amused by his own harshness. “So once you abandon her, she will start drinking again?” Aedior sighed. “You are pretty mean, Jon.”<br><br>
                            “‘Ey...” Jon trailed off. He cocked his head, narrowed his eyes, and smiled. “Gods, Aedior.”<br><br>
                            A moment passed. “Wait... So then, what is the point of this even? Like, what’s the purpose?”<br><br>
                            “No clue, I just feel—”<br><br>
                            “Isn’t having a girlfriend a waste of time, then? You should spend more time, for example, playing kick-ball.”<br><br>
                            “Screw kick-ball. Lame. Anyway, you’re just so lonely that you want my girlfriend.”<br><br>
                            “Uhh... no, Jon, I would never want a drunken girl. You just have very strange tastes.”<br><br>
                            Ieiro asked Jon something, and they went back and forth. For Aedior, it was normal that he was not the pivot of a conversation. He extracted himself from the conversation unnoticed and walked ahead of Ieiro and Jon. <i>I wonder if I’m just faking it. Saying all these inefficient words, this idle, meaningless talk, so that I seem like a talkative person. I’m not really like this...</i> He pictured himself yelling at his future wife, like he did to his parents. Then he pictured himself acting funny to his future wife, like he did with Jon. <i>Which one is the true me?</i><br><br>
                            Aedior looked at Ralf, who walked in front of the three of them. Ralf had on a stern face and was looking at the ground. <i>Why doesn’t he join the conversation?</i> Aedior looked back at Ieiro and Jon, who were deep in conversation. He waited for a while, as the four of them passed by smithies, potters, and small shops.
                            Still Ralf remained aloof.<br><br>
                            <i>How could</i> Ralf, <i>out of all people, be alone? How could he? He always talks, and it’s not an exaggeration. It’s as if he has just been equated with me in sociability. That’s heck impossible.</i><br><br>
                            Images of all the people he had ever met in his life flashed before his eyes. <i>All of them smile and laugh and surround themselves with friends. But friends are... less than friends, in truth. They’re only there if they are entertained by you. Like a theater audience.</i><br><br>
                            <i>It’s all about making other people laugh.</i><br><br>
                            <i>Perhaps all people are like Ralf, sewing a veil of a supposedly lively social life. Because quietness is boring and bad. Because loneliness is shunned and bad.</i>
                            <i>So every person is just like me, except they happen to draw in more people. An interesting and very believable... distortion. Debatable, of course, but still...</i><br><br>
                            A few golden rays shone through the clouds. Discord always won.<br><br>
                            <i>We’re all forgotten, in the end. Not just me. Nobody a century from now would know my name, much less care about my suffering from loneliness. Nobody a century from now would laugh or sigh at the crazy and harsh Jon. All we can do is live and try to improve our lot.</i><br><br>
                            Perhaps Aedior could reconcile with himself, reconcile with his fear of loneliness and silence and with his fear of being forgotten. Because all of humanity was just like him.

                            Say you have a big ol’ textbook. The school year has ended, and you want nothing to do with books. So you simply toss it in the garbage (not even in a recycling bin). Assuming all garbage reaches a landfill, the textbook completely rots away in the landfill in as little as ten years. Not to mention that minerals from the paper will enrich the soil.<br>
                            The same cannot be said for an iPad.<br>
                            According to Apple's iPad 2 Environmental Status Report, the iPad is made of “recyclable aluminum and glass.” However, few if any electronics recycling programs exist in the world. Notably, the U.S. virtually lacks one. In order to recycle materials, electronics must be disassembled. A few people in third-world countries do what disassembling even happens with U.S. electronics. In the process, they expose themselves to hazardous chemicals. These chemicals can just as likely end up in landfills, poisoning the soil. Even considering the “mercury-free” display and other chemical merits, iPads are not made of the safest substances.<br>
                            iPad materials manufacturing creates a lot of (mostly air) pollution, as it is.<br>
                            At best, iPads match books in environmental cost.<br><br>
                            <b>Sticky Fingers</b><br>
                            The Riordan administration aptly addressed the problem of theft last spring. During the announcement of the iPad program, they mentioned a safety measure—a “record of ownership” that tracks iPads connected to school’s wireless network. At least a few students and parents had doubts reassured.<br>
                            Less than a month after the beginning of this schools year, half a dozen iPads were permanently stolen on campus. No doubt, today’s electronics are valuable and highly coveted. To top it off, iPads are extremely visible due to their size.<br>
                            Tracking only works so well. Most obviously, a device disconnected from or taken beyond the physical limits of the Riordan network can no longer be tracked using the school “record of ownership.” Furthermore, an iPad lacking 3G/4G capability—which the school has recommended students buy—can only be tracked by law enforcement if the iPad connects to a wifi network. Excluding home wifi, finding and connecting to an unsecured wifi network is already a miracle.
                            Required registration of an iPad in the school network record is a good start toward safety. But it only does so much.<br><br>
                            <b>Keeping Up with the iApple</b><br>
                            We all groan about it outside, but cheer inside. That old iPad 1 of yours cannot be updated beyond iOS 5. Now you have a good reason to buy a sleek new iPad 3. Well, there are other things Apple likes to change every so often, and they are not so great.<br>
                            With the release of the iPhone 5 (as well as the iPod Touch 5 and the iPod Nano 7), Apple introduced a new docking connector called “Lightning.” It replaces the old 30-pin connector, but it only works with Apple’s three newest products. Including an adapter, so that you can still charge all your older devices, you will be shelling out $50 for these new accessories.<br>
                            Next year or so, a new iPad will also use the Lightning connector. Expect the school to recommend the new iPad for its even faster processor, larger RAM, and so on; expect to spend more money by 2014. It costs to huddle in the Apple bandwagon.<br><br>
                            <b>Other Costs</b><br>
                            Electronic books. They save paper. True. They are easier to carry around. True. They are cheaper. Well…<br>
                            Novels cost about the same between paperback and electronic. Of Mice and Men is $9.99 at the local Barnes and Noble? iBooks posts the same price. Also, many books, especially textbooks, are on a “digital rental system,” in which you can use a book for merely a period of time (typically 180 days). The AP U.S. History hardcover textbook costs $150, while the electronic version costs $100 for a 180-day license. At first, the electronic one seems more economical. However, once considering that the class is one-and-a-half semesters long, and that the book is necessary to study for the AP exam in May, the hardcover version trumps all.<br><br>
                            A central justification of our school’s iPad program—that iPads will save money—is void.

                            The professor for my public speaking class had just told us to improvise a story with two conditions: it had to be decently humorous and autobiographical. I should’ve been overjoyed; I had written fiction in high school and before. Instead, I panicked – my mind was blank. What stories I did recall were either neutral or pessimistic or those of friends. How had I gotten to this point?
                            <br><br>
                            Heading into Northwestern, I saw a brave new world. I’d most likely stumble a bit at first, but would thrive at the end of the day just as in high school.
                            <br><br>
                            Three years later, I’m unable to recall what that confidence felt like. In quick succession I joined and lost several groups of friends, feeling worse with each disruption. Though I enjoy my field of study here, at times it feels forced, and most times I feel incompetent. Uncomfortable trends have arisen, including frequent nightmares of abandonment. Still, college has helped me in one manner: I’m a four-hour flight from home, and it’s allowed me to reflect on how I got to this point.
                            <br><br>
                            Only after leaving home did I understand just how much my upbringing defined me and how little my conscious choices have been my own. Our parents have an outsized influence on our lives. They influence the religion we practice, the political ideology we hold and, of course, our ethnicity and financial situation. And, sometimes, their past shadows us.
                            <br><br>
                            Since I can remember, my mother has told the story of her brothers. However “egalitarian” Mao Zedong’s China was, my mother’s parents placed preferential treatment on her two brothers, as was tradition. The household chores, academic expectations and smallest food portions would go to her and her sister. Much later, one brother was dead of stomach cancer at a young age, and the other has a destructive gambling addiction and a broken family of his own. My mother links her brothers’ fates to their pampered upbringing.
                            <br><br>
                            So she projected her past onto me. She blocked my attempts to go outside or play games with friends. Moderate purchases — clothes not on sale or fiction books — became leverage for good grades and better behavior. When I became a rebellious teenager, she took every opportunity to remind me of my broken commitments: I was an ungrateful son, I must not have any friends with that attitude, my grades would get me nowhere, I should model myself after a family friend’s child, I did not deserve to live under her roof. Tutoring school and test preparation became the only activities free of criticism and “productive toward my success.” I became what my mother’s brothers should have been.
                            <br><br>
                            In turn, I grew up with an overwhelming sense of shame and an inability to develop interests. When I transferred schools in sixth grade, I failed to fit in. I tried but couldn’t relate to peers. In subsequent years, friends and classmates avoided being in my project groups, and my academics became tied to my troubles with relationships. My mother’s influence spared nothing. Isolated and criticized, I turned inward and internalized guilt.
                            <br><br>
                            My fear of isolation controls my life. The closer I get to friends, the more I fear losing them. When my first friends at NU began disregarding messages and plans, I bottled up my stress until I ended up bedridden for a week. I silence my thoughts, scared they can be used against me and I stomach blame, even if excessive, to preserve my relationships. When someone I trusted discussed with a recent group of friends how I did not deserve a relationship based on my faults, I believed it. I have to exaggerate what common interests I do have, like my field of study. And with each lost friend, I have no choice but to counteract a growing distrust of people with a growing fear of isolation, starting the cycle anew.
                            <br><br>
                            I watch my friends bear the pasts of their parents. One suffers from occasional breakdowns, as his parents keep wondering what they did wrong concerning his sexual orientation. Another marches toward ambition and orderly working life to patch memories of a parent’s divorce that unraveled family life. Yet another is driven by the hope of financial independence, seeking to cut off his father. Their childhoods persist with them.
                            <br><br>
                            I also hear of those who admire their parents. One dreams of deeper immersion in her culture and serving at her synagogue, as her mother does. Another teaches to “serve others” just as his parents, both doctors, did. Their childhoods, too, persist with them.
                            <br><br>
                            I don’t know if I can, or should, ever break out of the shadow of my mother. Even if I do, her past so deeply defines me that I wonder what would be left. I’m unsure if I should despise or sympathize with her or how to explain my discomfort of going home during breaks to well-meaning colleagues.
                            <br><br>
                            For all that’s happened, relationships have also kept me going. At the beginning of this quarter, I saw many familiar faces in class, at work and at the activities fair. And, they surprised me: hugs, reminiscences about old times, exasperation that three years had gone by, encyclopedic fill-ins about the summer and smiles. They were glad to see me, and I them. At that moment I felt like a human being, like I belonged at NU. They reminded me that I can still cherish the relationships I have, that negotiating the shadows of parents does not have to be a solitary journey.
